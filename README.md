<h1> 341 Group Project </h1>
<h2> COSC 241 - Human Computer Interaction</h2>

In this project, our team developed a food-waste app, 2Fresh2Waste. The goal of this app was to create a platform
for local farmers and producers to sell their unused produce to minimize food waste.

This app was completely built in Android Studio. All of our UI was drafted in Figma first as well, https://www.figma.com/design/pj9FcFbO2yQBI2WbWh9EUR/COSC341?node-id=0-1&t=46wWoYUz8TFfaL5I-1.
